# Open Exchange Website Widget

This is an implementation of a client for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning).

## What’s all this about?

It’s all part of a [collaborative project](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) for learning web development and software engineering. All backed by an experienced software engineer and teacher who has stepped away after twenty years in software development to concentrate on teaching.
